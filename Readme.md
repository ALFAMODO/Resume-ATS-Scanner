# Resume ATS Tracking

## Project Overview
Our ATS Tracker provides a comprehensive analysis of resumes to determine how well they match specific job descriptions. We use AI-based models to extract and evaluate content from resumes, focusing on relevant keywords, skills, and experience. Users can upload their resumes in PDF format, and the system offers feedback on areas of strength and suggestions for improvement.

## Methods of Analysis
- **Image Reading**: This method uses optical character recognition (OCR) to read text from image-based resumes, allowing us to work with resumes in various formats, even if they're not traditional text-based PDFs.
- **Text Reading**: This method extracts text directly from PDF resumes to analyze the content. It's useful for evaluating resumes based on keywords, skill sets, and other textual elements.

## Benefits
Our ATS Tracker benefits both job seekers and employers:
- **Job Seekers**: Get detailed feedback on how your resume aligns with specific job descriptions. Understand what skills are crucial for your target role and receive personalized recommendations for improvement.
- **Employers**: Quickly evaluate candidates' resumes based on specific job requirements. Our system helps streamline the hiring process by identifying the best-suited candidates through ATS analysis.
